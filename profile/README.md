# Welcome to the Capture The Flame Github Page! 🎊


## What is Capture The Flame? 🤔

🔥 Capture the Flame is a Intercollegiate Capture the Flag Event for all students across Illinois 🔥

Capture the Flag is a cyber security competition where students are asked to look for strings that are essentially the solution in different programmed puzzles called Challenges! These 'strings' are known as flags! 🚩

These flags give students points, students with the most points win! 👑

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to build a supportive cybersecurity
community across universities. Noticing a lack of
resources, we aim to advocate for cybersecurity courses
and majors, giving students more opportunities in this
field. Through collaboration with other organizations, we
strive to encourage more students to pursue careers in
cybersecurity and to develop the next generation of
cyber defenders.
